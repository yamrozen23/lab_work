Speaker A,     I think it's supposed to be a bit better.

Speaker B,"     Yeah, not too much, but a little bit. It's one tense. I always, like, say once it starts when you're lightning in the sky, like, that's kind of cool. I don't did I remember before 15, I was in the gas up in Panama and there's like, big, big lightning storm.

Speaker B,"     You couldn't go out of the house. The lightning would have hit, like, say, that the fields right beside the house. We're at lucky, but hit the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             "
Speaker B,"     I changed skills and stuff when I was in fifth year and went up to the Institute of Education. Kids in my area at the institute all over the world, like every continent in the world. And say, if you talk and I was like, kids that came from Africa, like to tell you about some crazy weather storms, like thunder, lightning, and not like hail coming down from the sky, but not normal hail and sleep.

Speaker B,     Like we get in Ireland with rocks coming down from the sky. Icy rocks.

Speaker B,"     Thank you. There'll be one thing to remember was going to school up and up on leases in my area saying, like, people like yourself. And also say people like yourself.

Speaker B,"     But like, a lot of say, like a wider race. It's like kind of like food, adopters, like and stuff like that. You wouldn't have got too many Irish kids going to say, like, Buddha doctors anymore.

Speaker B,"     So like, the African african kids, like our Asian kids and stuff like that. One of our mates from town and his family, they're originally from Malaysia and say they're look on medicine and be quite a bit different to most Europeans looked on medicine. Most Europeans like they're sick.                                                                                                                                                                     "
Speaker B,"     They'll go to the doctor to get a prescription, to go to the pharmacy, get tablets or a drink. They're right to drain them in a week to ten days left. My friend from Baku, he's already from the Congo and Africa, like like, say they went back to Congo, like, say you're sick or something.

Speaker B,"     It's really cool. But it definitely does make them stand out in a different light that if I had a dark kid myself, I wouldn't really be encouraging them to grow big after, like, say, maybe it's Halloween, but that would be where this I remember my friend back from Nice, anthony Offender. I used to go to school Nice and the CBS, he wore his afro into school and say it at lunchtime.                                                                   "
Speaker B,"     If you're seeing all the things that he'd be pulling out of his afro, people would be sticking pens dirt off the floor, thrown into this. He wouldn't feel it going in on physics.

Speaker B,     He's under five foot zero or at max five foot one and he's dead skin. That'd be the wishful environment.

Speaker B,"     Remember he came up to watch one of our training and there's one of the Poles players that's the big massive tall player at the time, got him lift him up, jumped up to the hoop and put him sitting at the hoop. Yeah.

Speaker B,"     Something like, say, it was fairly daunting for Adam just sitting in the hoop. The hoops 10ft high.

I remember before from Pee, when it's back in the CBS, and I say, if you playing rugby and p playing rugby with some yola same age, but they've been say if you're talking teams that they playing rugby for rugby for Lancer, maybe say one or two of them might be playing"
,
Speaker B,"     There are two guys in my ear back in the CBS and nice that they tried vote we vote for Lancer and Ireland. Daniel Burn from Kell and Om Connor from Nays. And Daniel Burn would be probably say an inch or two smaller main height, but say width wise, he'd be about under seven or eight inches onto my width, like, and I I wouldn't be skinny myself, like, that's too big for such a young age.

Speaker B,"     Yes, they do indeed. But the young lads that I'm going to skill would be saying that I would be playing rugby for the problems. It's like Lens or Monster Connor Ulster or else like very, very like, you know, elite club teams, like, you know, say playing playing for donnybrook, playing for knives, playing for the sweepstakes and stuff like that. Nice generally always have good teams, no matter what sports like that get.                            "
Speaker B,"     Gaelic, curling, rugby, golf, tennis.

Speaker A,     So three times the average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Speaker B,"     That's exceptional, isn't it? I remember when I was about 16, he split tennis to Midlands. I say playing tennis for tennis for lens and like, there were some young kids, like young lads and young girls and on the lens they're squad now. They'd be like damn, damn close to taking up tennis as a professional sport and making their money through tennis. I remember when I was on the Midland squad, like at 16, there was young kids to squad that would have played tennis at Wimbledon,"

Speaker B,     I was now close to that level at all. What are your favorite sport yourself? Rugby.

How would you know?

Like, I say that the highest level of Arsenal played. We say when I say six in seven in playing basketball for the for the Midlands, they say playing basketball for Lens.

Speaker B,"     But say on the Midland team, I'm the smallest player, I think the next smallest fair in the same room. Six foot five or six foot six, which is massively. On the Midland same, that wouldn't have been considered tall.

Speaker B,"     Like, you'd have to be six foot ten or six foot eleven to be considered tall on the Midland same, which is proper giant size. Isn't that gas? When you look at the NBA on the tallest players, the NBA is a Chinese man. Yao means seven, six and a half thousand.

It's one of the things I remember when I was going to school in Dublin up the dance chip that you'd say young lads and girls have access to all the money in the world, but it can't help them with everything. It generally caused more problems than it bring the solution to remember this is most violent school we made him saying he would have came from one of the richest families in the world like work wise but his dad did his dad as an oil sheet diamond mine.

Speaker B,"     I don't know how many zillion he would have had like that's a father. I generally just, like they say, comfortable, like, you know, have my house, have my car, have had enough to say to go on one or two holidays a year and then just the rest for just living, like, say, shopping, don out family and friends and stuff like that. I remember when I was going to school and leased up at the end, I was going to go to school with kids.                    "
Speaker B,"     Did it come from like the extreme richest and wealthiest families in the world? Like, you wouldn't be talking millions usually you wouldn't be talking billions.

If you had most people in the world that have that kind of money, if you put their lives under trash, wouldn't you like people wanting to rob from you, take this after the other off, stuff like that."
Speaker B,"     I used to ask for the condominium and Dublin near Neil's Cross. And remember we used to train on Friday on a Friday evening, half six to half eight. But I remember walking through the car park, like, you'd hear say, like, you know, glass being broken and say, another minute later here the caravan started up and driven off at speed.

They wouldn't take it. But my dad, he's a big hydraulic jack in the back of the Jeep.                                                                                                                                    "
Speaker B,"     And I think cost wise, for the hydraulic jack, it wouldn't be cheaper than 450. Good.

Speaker B,"     I remember when I was going to school up on the least, my dad say she talked, and I'd say, just the young girls that in school. I mean, like, say the dress, the the dresses that they would wear to the dad. How much would you think one on the dress of the cost for just one one big night out? No toast. Like made by hand, made by the proper big designers, like your Dosh and Gabana Chanel, your Prada dior Gucci.                                       "
Speaker B,"     You know your designers, you know your brand from going school up against it.

Speaker A,     There wouldn't be much discussion with the designer brands. It's a very different word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Speaker B,"     I remember when I changed schools and I said 50 and I was at institute of education lease. And certainly they wouldn't have been kids 18th birthday. So they get their first ex wife BMW, Jeep, odd Jeep, Mercedes, Jeep, homer, Jeep, or two seater sports car. It would be given to them under 17th birthday with daddy and Beck.                                                                                                                               "
Speaker B,"     These kids at all have money in their bank accounts or wherever they saved, topped up, if not weekly, monthly by daddy. He wouldn't be just putting in a few bubbles, like putting in a couple of grand every month. There's something definitely wrong about that ball, isn't it?

Speaker B,"     Doesn't seem right to anyone. I remember that the dads I had up at the end city. You should have seen some of the vehicles that young kids have been arriving. There's a few stretched Hummers that said they've taken three different couples, six in the homer.                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
Speaker B,"     Then there's there's kids, kids arriving and like, what were two seater sports cars, but they made a bit larger. Like, they have two seats in the back. Like, I know it kind of defeats the purpose on a racing car to have seats in the back, like, but for the dad.

That's one of the things that I was like doing with my dad.

Speaker B,"     One of my dad's friends, he lives in Hope in Dublin. Probably my dad's wealthiest friend. He wouldn't have millions, he wouldn't have billions.

Speaker B,"     He had either trillions or zillions. It's a bit similar work but he's got he's kind of retired from most of them now. 1015 years ago he was an oil sheet diamond miner and landslike him and say if you're talking with the lands account he could land at least four out of five companies, if not all five.

Speaker B,"     Are we good? Excessive of all of them. Say if you sold off all this all this land and all this valuables you wouldn't be making millions, you wouldn't be making billions.

It's gone a bit now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaker B,     It's tricky enough because I do know that she has passed away and she's gone. But not all the time. Am I aware of something? I won't forget that she's gotten it today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Speaker B,     But say tomorrow morning when I wake up at home I might call up to my parents bedroom. Say just don't make a start of breakfast or trying to cook tea or anything.

Speaker A,     The relationship with your man is quite different.

Speaker B,"     I got on brilliant, but both my parents announced it. Like, I remember when I was going to school Dublin at the Institute in Lee's, and said, Dublin kids in my ear that they have absolutely dreadful relationships. Their parents say they could flip over the smallest thing and be effing and blind and all kinds of kinds of profanities coming out of their mouth towards either their mom or their dad. Could be the simplest thing that could set them off, say, if they're not given their"

Speaker B,"     I remember when I was going to school and lease and sweet, I would have gone to school kids, really spoiled kids from the extreme richest and wealthiest families in the world. You wouldn't be talking kids come from millionaire, billionaire, a trillionaire families be talking kids come from, like, a zillionaire families. I don't mean to keep going on with that Muslim laugh, but Mason is saying, like, workwise.                                      "
Speaker B,"     What his dad said is his dad was an oil sheep dying of minor and land again. And say if you're talking continents, that his dad had landed when I knew his dad had landed, four out of the five, like, let's say probably at Landon in every continent now. Like, it's kind of too extremely rich.                                                                                                                                                                "
Speaker B,"     Falls, like, say, nearly, nearly every time the phone the phone a drain or the ballad Rain at the house, like, you know, I hear someone looking for some more money or something like that, wouldn't it? Like, one of my aunts, my mom said the family lives up on the closures and posh areas of the Donship, the sweepstakes of the Donnybrook Cliff. And they're class apartments, but they're two and a half story apartments, like, with lovely balconies, one at the front, one at the back,"

Speaker B,"     Save my aunt was selling her residence in Desmond. She had multimillions for multi, but she had four and a half million for her accommodation. Anyway, she has lived in not bad places, but places that wouldn't be anywhere in the ballpark of the.

Speaker B,     Like like we we lived in Roseville ourselves on when we were building a new house. I loved it because it was innate and it was close to all my friends. You could leave leave the house anytime a day and whatever directory you'd meet for one year makes quick enough.                                                                                                                                                                                          
Speaker B,"     It was good, but like remember when was going to school at least straight up at the end? Shit. I wouldn't go to school to kids that come from like the elite, richest, wealthiest family in the world.

Speaker B,"     You'll be talking billions of trillions or quadrillions, which is too big of a number to even comprehend all of them. I don't mean to keep bringing up that Muslim life from saying it will probably under the richest lads and skills me like work guys have a dad that his dad is an oil cheek diamond minor and Lands account. And say if you're talking about the Lands account but I know he had landed at least four extra five cabinets.                   "
Speaker B,"     He probably has landed all five of them. Now.
