If you read that for five minutes, it just kind of lists that all they do is they bring you up. I have a few concerns for you that might help you and help me.

Speaker C,"     But I'm very interested in my son and to be there from all kinds. So the first letter is just a summary. I spoke on behalf of Hugh, and I asked you to sign it and said, Hugh, would you like me to see Paul and to speak up for you? Because I feel that my son, because of his condition, every ten minutes he forgets.

Speaker C,"     And all I really want if it's possible, if it's possible, because I never ask you, what do you say? He will say, I talk at home, and I talk about yes, fact. And then it's like because I know I've been living with my son for seven years, so that's the first thing. So what I wanted was all you have to say.                                                                                                                                                 "
Speaker C,"     This is a solution. He was doing very good, which you hear, and I'll back him to the hill.

Speaker C,"     But I don't know. Is there a plan afoot? Is there a goal set that maybe in a year's time you might be able to this or whatever?

Speaker C,     Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Speaker B,"     The therapy is is a space yeah. For you to to explore yes. You know, his his own yes. Inner experience.

Speaker C,     Yes. Okay. But here's the part from living with my son. He has to be led.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Speaker C,     That's the point. That's what I feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Speaker B,     Yeah. But not in this process.

Speaker B,"     Yeah. I feel like I've said enough already and I really feel that this is an intrusion into well, I think into therapy. I have an obligation as Hughes therapist to protect his space and to protect confidentiality.

Speaker B,     It's up to him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Speaker C,"     We can make him up. So he was that okay. I know you can of your hand, and he's part of the great man.

Speaker C,"     I need now and then I text myself, and so I thank you for the time. Sorry for interrupting, but I don't have to that's okay.

Speaker B,     I'm just trying to think that there's about this we did talk before about maybe yourself and being supported and all of that. It might be helpful for us to think about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Speaker C,     Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Speaker B,     Because I think you clearly are you're finding it difficult at times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Speaker C,     I did this session because I stopped and your colleagues have come back and see me again. And I did ask I was in these sessions. I don't know that three I went for. Then I went to a five or six and then took a break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Speaker C,     And my understanding she was to contact me again. She gave me a bit of space.

Speaker C,"     Yeah. But for what it's worth, I'm a happier man in myself, and I spend a living, and I've accepted a lot. Accepted a lot. And I'm there for a few and so forth, and whatever's good for him, I'll go for that.

Speaker C,"     Okay. So I accept when he comes home, he's very welcome, and I'd like him to come home more if he could, but I don't think he's ready enough for that.

Speaker B,"     I'm just thinking now about clearly there is maybe a need for us to maybe have some kind of forum where we can we can leave if you need to, you know you know, and address concerns. Because I'm I'm just worried about, you know, about this in in the sense of your you know, your your opinion and, you know, what you what you think is going on, but there's a sense that you think it's not helpful for you.

Speaker C,"     Steve was put in hand, but you said it's an emotional thing. You might not see the effects and it's good. And we talk about whatever you talk about.

Speaker B,     It's not something that served well within the brain injury community environment. So there's lots of focus on cognitive rehabilitation. But a person person with a brain with a brain experience of brain injury is still a person like you or me.

Speaker A,     His parents are Malaysian. But his work was put his dad did back in Malaysia. He was an oil street diamond miner and landslide and safety be comparing the land that he had in Malaysia inside of Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaker A,"     He'd have a bit more land than all of Ireland back in Malaysia. In my head it's a bit too excessive. His dad wouldn't be a millionaire, wouldn't be billionaire, wouldn't be a trillionaire.

Speaker A,     Instead of being a zillionaire and more than likely hundreds of thousands of zillions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Speaker B,     How do you feel about what's just happened?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Speaker A,     That's fine. I'm fine with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Speaker B,     And what are your thoughts about the sessions and about what your dad was?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaker A,"     I genuinely enjoy the sessions, Paul. I never fail. As if there's just any pressure on me or as if I'm expected to say this after the other. I just talk away free mindedly.

Speaker A,     And I enjoy the sessions. I enjoy having a chat. There's always a nice award at the end of my go for a nice lunch with my dad afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Speaker A,     So I'm happy. I wouldn't put an end to these sessions at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Speaker C,     Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Speaker B,     I think it is important in light of this that we do maybe just explore that over that piece again about the sessions and about.

Just to reiterate these sessions I don't decide when they finish either.

But I think the bird tell think it was a Jack Ross and took it upside up 200ft.

But say when he was that age, he looked as if he was mid to late 30s, if not early forty s.                                                                "

Speaker B,     Some of his concerns about you and about what goes on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Speaker A,     What are his concerns?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Speaker B,     He was concerned about the therapy. The nature of the therapy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Speaker A,     Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Speaker B,     What goes on in the therapy. I think he wanted to know what we talk about in here. The therapy is open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Speaker A,     Ended up with anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Speaker B,"     Yeah. But also I have the sense that he really wanted to know what was going on here, and that's understandable in a way, but it puts me in a really difficult position.

Speaker A,     You can say anything about perceptions. I don't mind.

Speaker A,     Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Speaker B,     Because you're a therapist and I can't speak to a third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Speaker A,     But that's what happens in your it's.

Speaker A,"     It's one of the things I kind of find my memory, like, say, 1015 minutes after reception, say, have a lunch with my dad. My dad asks, So what are you talking about, Paul today? And it's kind of a blank that comes up. Paul?

Speaker B,"     But that's very difficult for your dad. I think, you know, that there are there are things that we talk about.

That's hard. Yeah. But at the same time, I think it's important for you to have the.                                                                                      "

Speaker B,"     Why I'm bringing it up again is that I think your your dad can see clearly.

Being honest with you, public, I genuinely would like to be that ridiculously wealthy.

Are they with me because they like, has all the money? Are they with me because they actually like me?

Speaker C,"     A second was I asked you to sign up, and I kind of tabulated my thoughts, and whether it's a Pokemon, I vote to say something to go. But the first page is I wrote a different shoe talking to a letter to you, and I asked you to sign it. And I signed it. The second one was, I sent an email to Kate.                                                                                                                                                         "

Speaker C,"     Teammate. And I think and I said, a little confused, but will I turn up for the list back or turn up here? So my understand. And then the third better is an email to Nyla says it's his understanding that you told me the holiday period or something like that. So there's a confusion in that.                                                                                                                                                                "
Speaker C,"     But I'm very interested in my son and to be there from all kinds. So the first letter is just a summary. I spoke on behalf of Hugh, and I asked you to sign it and said, Hugh, would you like me to see Paul and to speak up for you? Because I feel that my son, because of his condition, every ten minutes he forgets.

Speaker C,"     And all I really want if it's possible, if it's possible, because I never ask you, what do you say? He will say, I talk at home, and I talk about yes, fact. And then it's like because I know I've been living with my son for seven years, so that's the first thing. So what I wanted was all you have to say.                                                                                                                                                 "
Speaker C,"     This is a solution. He was doing very good, which you hear, and I'll back him to the hill. That's what I want.

Speaker C,"     But I don't know. Is there a plan afoot? Is there a goal set that maybe in a year's time you might be able to this or whatever? So I need to know for Hugh's sake, because he doesn't really know what he's doing here. And that's the first page.

Speaker C,"     And the second one is I was asking would Lizra have happened to ask they said, no, we're not to do that. Hugh is unique in the whole world, and I live with my son.

Speaker C,"     No guidance. And I'm only the dad, and I get unrelevant, and I missed my weekend if he didn't come home.

Speaker C,"     And when he gets up in the morning, the routines, you might glean something from that. And then I wanted to share the moment when he gets up.

Speaker C,"     It's really good. And he does like coming in here, but the main thing is going for lunch after that kind of soap, and I never asked you for that.

Speaker C,"     I'm not worried about that school. I really, really like that.

Speaker B,"     It might be helpful. I mean, just from from this, like, really have a sense that you are worried and you're concerned and that you seem to have I think it might be based on your previous experience of psychological interventions in rehabilitation. And they are very much informed by the cognitive approach towards rehabilitation, and they're very fixed in terms of observable measurable elements. They identify deficits within views, cognitive repertoire and then put in plans and"

Speaker B,"     The effects, if you like, may not be obvious and may not be obvious straight away. So it's a very different approach. I'm only saying this by by way of maybe, you know, just inform you of the of the differences.

Again, I thank you, and I apologize for overstepping the mark and but I.

Speaker B,"     Don'T I don't take it like that. I'd be really keen for you not to have an unfavorable opinion of what happens here. What happens here. And this kind of work that you does is equally, if not more important than his cognitive rehabilitation.

Speaker B,     I'm just thinking about what's in what's in the letter and it really does seem to me as if it's coming from a place of not ignorance but of just not knowing and of a fear of the unknown in the sense of what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Speaker C,     No one else can address that. And I appreciate and that is sufficient. That's all I want my calculation done so he can't get that. He can't get it unless he comes here and that's unclean.

Then I went to a five or six and then took a break.

Speaker A,"     Class. That's not a holiday. Living abroad when I met some town he lives up in colonial his family, but he's originally from Malaysia and say if you're talking like European countries I think he spent nearly every European country spent fiber. Fiber.

Speaker A,     No. He spent about seven or eight different states in America. He spent to Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Speaker A,"     He spent Australia. He's only been to one or two places in Africa but he spent the Congo and he spent Egypt. He's taking up the world travel less, isn't it? He's come from a fairly well off family.

Speaker A,     His parents are Malaysian. But his work was put his dad did back in Malaysia. He was an oil street diamond miner and landslide and safety be comparing the land that he had in Malaysia inside of Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaker A,"     He'd have a bit more land than all of Ireland back in Malaysia. In my head it's a bit too excessive. His dad wouldn't be a millionaire, wouldn't be billionaire, wouldn't be a trillionaire.

Speaker A,     Instead of being a zillionaire and more than likely hundreds of thousands of zillions.

Speaker A,"     I genuinely enjoy the sessions, Paul. I never fail. As if there's just any pressure on me or as if I'm expected to say this after the other. I just talk away free mindedly.

Speaker A,     And I enjoy the sessions. I enjoy having a chat. There's always a nice award at the end of my go for a nice lunch with my dad afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Speaker A,     So I'm happy. I wouldn't put an end to these sessions at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Speaker C,     Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Speaker B,     I think it is important in light of this that we do maybe just explore that over that piece again about the sessions and about.

There are probably one of the richest young lads that was in school made like he's the same age as me. But when I was, say, 1718, I looked 1718. But say when he was that age, he looked as if he was mid to late 30s, if not early forty s.                                                                "

If you talk about the wealth that his dad would have between oil, diamonds and land how wealth would you say his dad would mention it before zillion or not million.

Speaker B,"     Yeah. But also I have the sense that he really wanted to know what was going on here, and that's understandable in a way, but it puts me in a really difficult position.

Speaker A,"     It's one of the things I kind of find my memory, like, say, 1015 minutes after reception, say, have a lunch with my dad. My dad asks, So what are you talking about, Paul today?

Paul?

That's hard. Yeah. But at the same time, I think it's important for you to have the.                                                                                      "

It's very different.                                                                                                                                                         "

Speaker A,"     I brought my girlfriend back to Nice. Naomi Clear. But like, the models models, we say between six foot two and six foot six and hype and say, that's what I just think. Stick ten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               "
Speaker A,"     We want to think to remember when it's going to go and up with the institute thing. Like, you see you see girls who we say model for, like the the top fashion agencies, like Mo, Chanel, Gucci, proud of Dior. Like, there's there's this one girl, she's from Rockfield and Dublin, but Ashley Finn was a name when she was 1718, she was like nearly every second week she'd be like, down South France doing model shoes, down Netflix.                       "
Speaker A,"     Often America, like, she's flown all over the world. She wouldn't have to have to pay for the flights that they're all paid for and like, say, if she was she was down and say, a nine a nine to nine to four modeling day in, say, the sale of France. How much do you think she'd make in that day? Between nine in the morning and 04:00 in the afternoon?                                                                                                     "

Speaker C,"     Teammate. And I think and I said, a little confused, but will I turn up for the list back or turn up here? So my understand. And then the third better is an email to Nyla says it's his understanding that you told me the holiday period or something like that. So there's a confusion in that.                                                                                                                                                                "
Speaker C,"     But I'm very interested in my son and to be there from all kinds. So the first letter is just a summary. I spoke on behalf of Hugh, and I asked you to sign it and said, Hugh, would you like me to see Paul and to speak up for you? Because I feel that my son, because of his condition, every ten minutes he forgets.

Speaker C,"     And all I really want if it's possible, if it's possible, because I never ask you, what do you say? He will say, I talk at home, and I talk about yes, fact. And then it's like because I know I've been living with my son for seven years, so that's the first thing. So what I wanted was all you have to say.                                                                                                                                                 "
Speaker C,"     This is a solution. He was doing very good, which you hear, and I'll back him to the hill.

Speaker C,"     But I don't know. Is there a plan afoot? Is there a goal set that maybe in a year's time you might be able to this or whatever? So I need to know for Hugh's sake, because he doesn't really know what he's doing here. And that's the first page.

Speaker C,"     And the second one is I was asking would Lizra have happened to ask they said, no, we're not to do that. Hugh is unique in the whole world, and I live with my son.

Speaker C,"     No guidance. And I'm only the dad, and I get unrelevant, and I missed my weekend if he didn't come home.

Speaker C,"     And when he gets up in the morning, the routines, you might glean something from that. And then I wanted to share the moment when he gets up.

Speaker C,"     It's really good. And he does like coming in here, but the main thing is going for lunch after that kind of soap, and I never asked you for that.

Speaker C,"     I'm not worried about that school. I really, really like that.

Speaker B,"     It might be helpful. I mean, just from from this, like, really have a sense that you are worried and you're concerned and that you seem to have I think it might be based on your previous experience of psychological interventions in rehabilitation. And they are very much informed by the cognitive approach towards rehabilitation, and they're very fixed in terms of observable measurable elements. They identify deficits within views, cognitive repertoire and then put in plans and"

Speaker B,"     The effects, if you like, may not be obvious and may not be obvious straight away. So it's a very different approach. I'm only saying this by by way of maybe, you know, just inform you of the of the differences.

Again, I thank you, and I apologize for overstepping the mark and but I.

Speaker B,"     Don'T I don't take it like that. I'd be really keen for you not to have an unfavorable opinion of what happens here. What happens here. And this kind of work that you does is equally, if not more important than his cognitive rehabilitation.

Speaker B,     I'm just thinking about what's in what's in the letter and it really does seem to me as if it's coming from a place of not ignorance but of just not knowing and of a fear of the unknown in the sense of what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Speaker C,     No one else can address that. And I appreciate and that is sufficient. That's all I want my calculation done so he can't get that. He can't get it unless he comes here and that's unclean.

Then I went to a five or six and then took a break.

Speaker A,"     Class. That's not a holiday. Living abroad when I met some town he lives up in colonial his family, but he's originally from Malaysia and say if you're talking like European countries I think he spent nearly every European country spent fiber. Fiber.

Speaker A,     No. He spent about seven or eight different states in America. He spent to Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Speaker A,"     He spent Australia. He's only been to one or two places in Africa but he spent the Congo and he spent Egypt. He's taking up the world travel less, isn't it? He's come from a fairly well off family.

Speaker A,     His parents are Malaysian. But his work was put his dad did back in Malaysia. He was an oil street diamond miner and landslide and safety be comparing the land that he had in Malaysia inside of Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Speaker A,"     He'd have a bit more land than all of Ireland back in Malaysia. In my head it's a bit too excessive. His dad wouldn't be a millionaire, wouldn't be billionaire, wouldn't be a trillionaire.

Speaker A,     Instead of being a zillionaire and more than likely hundreds of thousands of zillions.

Speaker A,"     I genuinely enjoy the sessions, Paul. I never fail. As if there's just any pressure on me or as if I'm expected to say this after the other. I just talk away free mindedly.

Speaker A,     And I enjoy the sessions. I enjoy having a chat. There's always a nice award at the end of my go for a nice lunch with my dad afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Speaker A,     So I'm happy. I wouldn't put an end to these sessions at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Speaker C,     Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Speaker B,     I think it is important in light of this that we do maybe just explore that over that piece again about the sessions and about.

There are probably one of the richest young lads that was in school made like he's the same age as me. But when I was, say, 1718, I looked 1718. But say when he was that age, he looked as if he was mid to late 30s, if not early forty s.                                                                "

If you talk about the wealth that his dad would have between oil, diamonds and land how wealth would you say his dad would mention it before zillion or not million.

Speaker B,"     Yeah. But also I have the sense that he really wanted to know what was going on here, and that's understandable in a way, but it puts me in a really difficult position.

Speaker A,"     It's one of the things I kind of find my memory, like, say, 1015 minutes after reception, say, have a lunch with my dad. My dad asks, So what are you talking about, Paul today?

Paul?

That's hard. Yeah. But at the same time, I think it's important for you to have the.                                                                                      "

It's very different.                                                                                                                                                         "

Speaker B,     Who did you bring?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Speaker A,"     I brought my girlfriend back to Nice. Naomi Clear. But like, the models models, we say between six foot two and six foot six and hype and say, that's what I just think. Stick ten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               "
Speaker A,"     We want to think to remember when it's going to go and up with the institute thing. Like, you see you see girls who we say model for, like the the top fashion agencies, like Mo, Chanel, Gucci, proud of Dior. Like, there's there's this one girl, she's from Rockfield and Dublin, but Ashley Finn was a name when she was 1718, she was like nearly every second week she'd be like, down South France doing model shoes, down Netflix.                       "
Speaker A,"     Often America, like, she's flown all over the world. She wouldn't have to have to pay for the flights that they're all paid for and like, say, if she was she was down and say, a nine a nine to nine to four modeling day in, say, the sale of France. How much do you think she'd make in that day? Between nine in the morning and 04:00 in the afternoon?                                                                                                     "
Speaker B,     No idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Speaker A,"     No less than 80 grand. No more than 16. It's too good, though, if you're given that kind of money to young kids.
